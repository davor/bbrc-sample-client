FIND MIN FREQUENCY

Usage information for find_min_frequency.rb
Args: path/to/dataset.yaml ds_name backbone time_per_cmpd upper_limit lower_limit nr_com_ratio fminer_algo verbose

Required arguments:
  path/to/dataset.yaml: string e.g. "data/dataset_bbrc.yaml" which stores ds_names and their dataset_uris
  ds_name: string e.g. "MOU", needed to find correct dataset_uri
  backbone: true or false 
  time_per_cmpd: float, used to set max_duration of a feature calulation
  upper_limit: float, has to be larger than lower_limit. 
  lower_limit: float, has to be smaller than upper_limit. 
    - Number of features has to be between this limits. In this implementation the limits are 'number of compounds in training data' multiplied with upper-/lower_limit.  See link below "Practical Aspects" -> Main
phase 2.)
  nr_com_ratio: float between 0.1 and 0.75. Regulates how much features has to be calculated in initialization step. See link below "Practical Aspects" -> Initialization 4.)
  fminer_algo: bbrc or last 
  verbose: true or false, explain what is being done
